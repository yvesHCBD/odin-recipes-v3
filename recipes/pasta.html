                    <li>shaved Parmesan cheese to taste (optional)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><u>Directions</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and
                    line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
                <li> Trim about 2-inches of the bottom tough ends from the asparagus
                    spears and set aside. Cut remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces.
                    Spread out asparagus pieces and garbanzo beans on the prepared 
                    baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1/2 
                    teaspoon each salt, pepper and garlic powder; toss well to coat.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and beans are 
                    slightly toasted, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
                    reserved asparagus ends and cook until very tender. Remove with a slotted
                    spoon and place into a food processor or blender.</li>
                <li>Return water to boiling, add pasta, and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                    until tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 12 minutes (depending on pasta
                    variety) Drain pasta well and return to the pot.</li>
                <li>While pasta is cooking, combine Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original 
                    Almondmilk, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon of each salt, 
                    pepper, and garlic powder, lemon zest, and lemon juice in blender or food
                    processor with the boiled asparagus, Blend until sauce is smooth.</li>
                <li>Toss sauce with hot cooked pasta and stir in roasted asparagus and
                    garbanzo beans. Top with shaved Parmesan cheese, if desired. </li>
